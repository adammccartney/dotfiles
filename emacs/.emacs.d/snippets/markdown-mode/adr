# Identifier and Title (a statement of the decision made)

## Status
Draft/Decided/Superseded by ADR-XXX

## Context
Why you need to make the decision. Assumptions, constraints, and decision drivers.

## Evaluation Criteria
What is important to you in making this decision?
Which of your architectural characteristics apply to making this decision?
Should any constraints or decision drivers become a criterion?

## Options
Outlines of the options considered against the evaluation criteria (usually using a
score or rating), and trade-offs outside of the evaluation criteria.

## Decision
The choice that was made and why.

## Implications
The positive and negative consequences of the decision made.

## Consultation
If taking input from others, they should document it here. Details of those invited
to give input can be recorded, whether they provide input or not. Although
consultation takes place before a decision is made, it is documented at the end
because it can become long and obscure the decision itself.
